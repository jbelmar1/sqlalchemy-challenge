Module 10 Challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.


# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database
* Precipitation Analysis
* Station Analysis
* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
* List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

# Part 2: Design Your Climate App
* Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
